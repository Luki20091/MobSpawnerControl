debug: true

# Equipment-based detection: if a mob spawned by a spawner has any equipment (helmet, chestplate,
# leggings, boots, main/off hand item), the plugin will consult the per-mob setting
# `mobs.<MOB>.respawn-with-equipment` to decide whether to allow the spawn.

# Per-mob settings: only `respawn-with-equipment` is used by this plugin.
# If `respawn-with-equipment` is true for a mob type, the plugin will allow
# the spawner to spawn that mob with equipment. Otherwise, equipment will be
# removed at spawn (and the plugin will retry a few ticks to catch late equips).
# Example configuration:
mobs:
  SKELETON:
    respawn-with-equipment: false
  ZOMBIE:
    respawn-with-equipment: false
  
# Per-entity cleanup scheduling (no global loops):
# How many ticks after spawn to perform the first cleanup attempt.
cleanup-delay-ticks: 20
# How many times to retry cleaning a recently-spawned entity (per entity).
# This helps catch other plugins that equip mobs a few ticks after spawn.
# Increase to be more aggressive; decrease to reduce overall work.
cleanup-attempts: 2
