# MobSpawnerControl configuration

debug: true

# Equipment-based detection: if a mob spawned by a spawner has any equipment (helmet, chestplate,
# leggings, boots, main/off hand item), the plugin will consult the per-mob setting
# `mobs.<MOB>.respawn-with-equipment` to decide whether to allow the spawn.

# Per-mob settings. Sections for all mobs will be created automatically on first run.
# Each mob will get these keys (defaults shown):
#   respawn-with-equipment: false   # do NOT allow spawner to spawn equipped mobs by default
#   allow-any-drops: false          # if false and `drops` is empty, all drops are removed for spawner-spawned mobs
#   drops: {}                       # map of MATERIAL_NAME: true/false to allow specific drops

# How many pending equipment-clean operations to process per server tick.

# until newly spawned mobs are cleaned. Tune according to your server.
cleanup-per-tick: 1
# How many times to retry cleaning a recently-spawned entity (per entity).
# This helps catch other plugins that equip mobs a few ticks after spawn.
# Increase to be more aggressive; decrease to reduce overall work.
